# TODO:

List of pending changes.

- Make all icons and media (improve icons png)
- Make Android Interface
- Add option to publish user domain (if he wants to). Need to think where and how to publish them anonimously (to have a userbase public list)
- Fake message sending when the remote contact is not online and try to send it from a service running in the background
